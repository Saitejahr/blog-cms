      <p className='node-para'>Node.js has revolutionized server-side development with its efficient, event-driven architecture and vibrant ecosystem. Whether you're a seasoned developer or a newcomer, understanding Node.js can greatly enhance your ability to build scalable, high-performance applications. Let's delve into what Node.js is, its key features, and why it's such a popular choice for modern web development.Node.js is a runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser, making it ideal for building server-side applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for real-time applications that need to handle a large number of concurrent connections.</p>
